# AWS Cloud Cost Optimization - Identifying Stale Resources
 Description of the Project:

In this project, we aim to create a Lambda function using Python that communicates with the AWS API. The primary goal is to execute two key steps. First, we fetch all EBS snapshots, and second, we filter out the snapshots that are considered stale. Once identified, these stale snapshots will be promptly deleted. The purpose of this project is to efficiently manage storage costs by eliminating EBS snapshots that are no longer associated with active EC2 instances.
